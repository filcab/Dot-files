Stuff to check out
==================

* [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): fancy syntax-highlighter for diff stuff: *seems nice, testing on some machines*
* [`sad`](https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad): fancy regex search+replace with terminal previewer (with delta-like + (pager or fzf))
* [`sd`](https://github.com/chmln/sd): simple-case sed replacement (much faster, no language, just replacements)
* [bat-extras](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras): some interesting additions to bat for highlighting output from other commands

* [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/): has some interesting features, but doesn't feel like something I'd use for most of it. But some features look neat, like the commit graph visualization, "rebase magic", bisect UI, ...

Stuff to do
===========

* Write an auto-updater for bash/zsh completions for frequently used utilities which generate it via `$util --bash` or similar commands
* I thought I was using Dracula theme "everywhere", but vim has been using vim-aurora, which seems like a theme someone just made (and is nice).
